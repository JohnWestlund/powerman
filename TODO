* When querying power status, don't query all power controlers
* Failed action at the device level are never reported to the client
* Timeouts need to be added to the send/expect interactions with the devices.
* Increased warning/error verbosity from the client (and server)
* Build failure simulator test suite
* Package with autoconf
* Still several small memory leaks, find them
* Reformat code w/out tabs
* Remove any server side caching.  Consider disabling periodic polling.
  [Note: login timeouts are an issue if polling is disabled.]
* Investigate controling the timing of commands delivered to power controlers.
* powerman client needs to interpret response codes from server and clean
  them up (e.g. strip off numerical response prefixes) when shown to the user.
* powerman client needs to implement option for expanding hostranges
* powerman client needs option for querying status of individual node for
  Kimberlite failover interface.
* De-serialize commands issued to the devices.  They should be issued
  in parallel and the results colated. [Note: they appear to be issued in 
  parallel now, but delays are implemented as inline Delay() calls, thus
  delays are serialized. -jg]
* Find this bug in powermand (exhibited on mdev when doing a powerman -0 
  on one node):

* Audit code for reconnecting to power control devices.  Failure case: start
  powermand with vpcd config.  Start vpcd.  Reconnect does not occur until
  "update interval" expires (client activity doesn't cause reconnect).
  Subsequently, daemon does not prompt for commands.  SIGINT in the debugger  
  shows dev_process_select -> dev_handle_read -> buf_read -> ?? -> read.
* Reconnect algorithm should be sane: exponential backoff & retry with cap
  of one minute or so.
* Make it so commands involving scripts that are not defined result in errors.
  For example, PM_RESET script should be optional, and the user should be told
  of a PM_CYCLE is the only thing available, then they can try that.
