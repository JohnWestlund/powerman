* Bug: was able to kill powerman by running "while true; do pm -q; done"
  and interrupting with ^C after many iterations:
  client.c:416: _act_finish: Assertion `(c)->magic == 0xdeadbee0' failed.
* Build failure simulator test suite
* Package with autoconf
* Still several small memory leaks, find them
* Reformat code w/out tabs
* Power sequencing, e.g. max number of devices doing on/off/cycle in parallel
  per subpanel (and express device-subpanel relationship and subpanel max 
  parallelism in config file)
* powerman client needs to implement option for expanding hostranges
* Issuing a command involving an RPC that is currently in connect-retry mode
  causes the client to hang forever.  See FIXME note at bottom of device.c.
  (Bug: a lot of commands could be queued for a device that is down long term.)
* Make "soft" power status query possible again in server
* Client should have option for verifying soft power status (expand hostranges
  and issue warnings where plug is on but node is off).  Needs to be optional
  since would double cluster query latency.  
* Consider supporting additional ICE commands such as querying temperature and 
  beacon status in ice box, toggling beacon, extracting firmware version, 
  updating firmware, etc.  
* Consider supporting ice v3 ability to sequence >1 plug (e.g. ph 1,2,3) in 
  a single command.
* Consider a way for users to arbitrarily map a device script to a server 
  command (e.g. don't hard code the number of scripts?)
