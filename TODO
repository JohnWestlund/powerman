* Add option to not maintain persistant connections to RPC's, e.g. log out 
  after a timeout period and login again at the next command.
* Store scripts in a list and search the list for the script name, rather than
  hard code the list.   Make it possible to execute arbitrary scripts that
  are device specific, e.g. "pm --script scriptname".
* Package with autoconf/automake
* Power sequencing.  Provide a way of expressing the max number of outlets
  or power control devices which can be powered on in parallel.
* Client should have option for verifying soft power status (expand hostranges
  and issue warnings where plug is on but node is off).  Needs to be optional
  since would double cluster query latency.  
* Take an flock F_WRLCK on serial devices to peacefully coexist with conman.
* Powermand should execute logoff scripts on devices upon receipt of a signal
  (with timeout).
* Device timeout should be per expect line
* Redesign the device language to be more general.
* Fix hostlist_* error handling to use lsd errors
* Spec file should restart daemon if already running (see swmlogger.spec)
