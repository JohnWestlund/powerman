* Store scripts in a list and search the list for the script name, rather than
  hard code the list.  
* Build failure simulator test suite
* Package with autoconf
* Power sequencing.  Provide a way of expressing the max number of outlets
  or power control devices which can be powered on in parallel.
* Client should have option for verifying soft power status (expand hostranges
  and issue warnings where plug is on but node is off).  Needs to be optional
  since would double cluster query latency.  
* Take an flock F_WRLCK on serial devices to peacefully coexist with conman.
* Support IPMI 1.5 using a built-in device called "impi1.5".  Device 
  instantiations would be per network interface.  Plug names would be 
  ethernet addresses.
* Connect on demand option.
* Add a way to execute external scripts to do power control.
* Make sure 'service powerman stop' properly tears down tcp connections
