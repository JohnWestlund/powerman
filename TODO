* When querying power status, don't query all power controlers
* Invalid hosts are silently ignored, warning should be generated
* Failed action at the device level are never reported to the client
* Timeouts need to be added to the send/expect interactions with
  the devices.
* Increased warning/error verbosity from the client (and server)
* Build failure simulator test suite
* Package with autoconf
* Still several small memory leaks, find them
* Reformat code w/out tabs
* define out_of_memory() handler as fatal error.
* Remove any server side caching
* Investigate controling the timing of commands delivered to power
  controlers.
