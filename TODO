* When querying power status, don't query all power controlers
* Failed action at the device level are never reported to the client
* Timeouts need to be added to the send/expect interactions with the devices.
* Increased warning/error verbosity from the client (and server)
* Build failure simulator test suite
* Package with autoconf
* Still several small memory leaks, find them
* Reformat code w/out tabs
* define out_of_memory() handler as fatal error.
* Remove any server side caching
* Investigate controling the timing of commands delivered to power controlers.
* powerman client needs to interpret response codes from server and clean
  them up (e.g. strip off numerical response prefixes) when shown to the user.
* powerman client needs to implement option for expanding hostranges
* powerman client needs option for querying status of individual node for
  Kimberlite failover interface.
* De-serialize commands issued to the devices.  They should be issued
  in parallel and the results colated. [Note: they appear to be issued in 
  parallel now, but delays are implemented as inline Delay() calls, thus
  delays are serialized. -jg]
* Find this bug in powermand (exhibited on mdev when doing a powerman -0 
  on one node):
