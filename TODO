* Store scripts in a list and search the list for the script name, rather than
  hard code the list.  
* Build failure simulator test suite
* Package with autoconf
* Power sequencing.  Provide a way of expressing the max number of outlets
  or power control devices which can be powered on in parallel.
* Client should have option for verifying soft power status (expand hostranges
  and issue warnings where plug is on but node is off).  Needs to be optional
  since would double cluster query latency.  
* Make it possible to access a power control device via conman to support 
  in-band "service processor" arrangements e.g. Compaq RMC on AlphaServcer 
  line.  Perhaps spawn the conman client on a pipe for each power operation 
  or have conman create a unix domain socket that could be accessed by 
  powerman using existing capabilities.
* Support HTTP_DEV for devices such as the IBM RSA adapter that are most 
  efficiently managed that way.
* Take an flock F_WRLCK on serial devices to peacefully coexist with conman.
* Any serial-controlled device could be placed behind a terminal server and
  accessed via telnet.  Make this selectable via powerman.conf.
