* Bug: running "pm -q" in a tight loop against vpcd will occasionally result
  in read returning 0 in device.c, which results in disconnect/reconnect for
  that device, after which everything carries on.  (Bug may be in vpcd).
* Bug: actions cannot make progress towards timing out while devices are
  not connected.  
* Bug: since plug state is global and is reset before each status query, 
  simultaneous status queries will return unpredictable results.
  (NOTE: workaround applied in client.c::_parse_input() which depends on
  the "cannot make progress toward timing out" bug above.  See note there.)
* Bug: status query will not return unknown if device disconnects/reconnects
  (as in login timeout).  Client will see timeout, but will get bad data.
* Bug: query for N-1 plug states from an N plug device results in N-1
  queries (should always be one).
* Bug: need a way to deal with RPC's such as Baytech's which time out idle
  sessions such that first command typed after timeout will fail.
* Store scripts in a list and search the list for the script name, rather than
  hard code the list.  Enable ICE box temperature and beacon support by 
  allowing the client to execute arbitrary scripts.
* Define the arguments to a script in a flexible manner.
* PM_LOG_OFF action is not used - remove from the code.
* Build failure simulator test suite
* Package with autoconf
* Still several small memory leaks, find them
* Reformat code w/out tabs
* Powerman client needs to implement option for expanding hostranges
* Make "soft" power status query possible again in server
* Client should have option for verifying soft power status (expand hostranges
  and issue warnings where plug is on but node is off).  Needs to be optional
  since would double cluster query latency.  
* Consider supporting additional ICE commands such as querying temperature and 
  beacon status in ice box, toggling beacon, extracting firmware version, 
  updating firmware, etc.  
* Consider supporting ice v3 ability to sequence >1 plug (e.g. ph 1,2,3) in 
  a single command.
* Consider a way for users to arbitrarily map a device script to a server 
  command (e.g. don't hard code the number of scripts?)
* Power sequencing.  Provide a way of expressing the max number of outlets
  or power control devices which can be powered on in parallel.
* Support power control devices that are accessed via serial port.
* Move telnet protocol from device configuration into powermand.
