Short Term:
* Store scripts in a list and search the list for the script name, rather than
  hard code the list.  
* vpcd --hung_rpc can cause client to hang forever while login action
  repeatedly times out and is reinitiated ("real" action never makes it to 
  head of device queue).
* Replace bogus buffer.c with Chris's generic circular buffer module.

Long term:
* Build failure simulator test suite
* Package with autoconf
* Power sequencing.  Provide a way of expressing the max number of outlets
  or power control devices which can be powered on in parallel.
* Support power control devices that are accessed via serial port.
* Move telnet protocol from device configuration into powermand.
* Client should have option for expanding hostranges and printing results
  one per line (support Kimberlite scripts).
* Client should have option for verifying soft power status (expand hostranges
  and issue warnings where plug is on but node is off).  Needs to be optional
  since would double cluster query latency.
