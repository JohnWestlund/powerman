Short Term:
* Bug: read occasionally returns EOF for no apparent reason in vpc and icebox3.
  Note: seems to affect all vpcd devices in succession.
  Note: Splain this:
    Device vpc2 timed out
    Device vpc3 timed out
    Device vpc4 timed out
    Device vpc5 timed out
    Device vpc6 timed out
    Device vpc7 timed out
    on:      v[0-10]
    off:     v[11-16,24,32,40,48,56]
    unknown: v[17-23,25-31,33-39,41-47,49-55,57-63]
  expected on: v[0-10] off v[11-15] unknown [16-63]
  Bogus: 16,24,32,40,48,56 (first plug in each RPC that timed out)
* Bug: Deal with baytech login timeouts
* Store scripts in a list and search the list for the script name, rather than
  hard code the list.  
* Seperate scripts for "all" commands so we can get timing right on ice box.
* Reformat code w/out tabs
* vpcd --hung_rpc can cause client to hang forever.
* Make sure that tcp_wrappers works.
* Verify that 0 <= match_pos < MAX_MATCH in parser (now we assert in device.c)
* Attempt to initiate a command to devices that are delaying between
  reconnects should cause an immediate connect attempt.

Long term:
* Build failure simulator test suite
* Package with autoconf
* Powerman client needs to implement option for expanding hostranges
* Power sequencing.  Provide a way of expressing the max number of outlets
  or power control devices which can be powered on in parallel.
* Support power control devices that are accessed via serial port.
* Move telnet protocol from device configuration into powermand.
* Consider supporting ice v3 ability to sequence >1 plug (e.g. ph 1,2,3) in 
  a single command.
* Consider supporting additional ICE commands such as querying temperature and 
  beacon status in ice box, toggling beacon, extracting firmware version, 
  updating firmware, etc.  
* Make "soft" power status query possible again in server
* Client should have option for verifying soft power status (expand hostranges
  and issue warnings where plug is on but node is off).  Needs to be optional
  since would double cluster query latency.
