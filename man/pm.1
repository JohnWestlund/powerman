.SH NAME
pm \- issue power monitoring queries and power control commands

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pm
.I "[-options]"
.LP
.B pm
.I "[-options] [command]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pm
(for PowerMan) allows power monitoring and power management on a 
cluster of nodes to be performed independent of the underlying hardware.
Options are described in TARGET NODE LIST OPTIONS and OTHER OPTIONS below.
.LP
For a command in 
.I [on, off, reset]
.B pm
will power on, power off, or reset, respectively, the target nodes.  If
none of the above commands is provided 
.B pm
queries the target nodes for their power status and prints the names of 
those that are on, one per line (but see -t and -r below).
.LP
.B pm 
operates in conjuction with one or more underlying, hardware-specific
utilites, each of wich conforms to a uniform interface.    
.B pm 
runs on a management workstation equipped with power monitoring and 
control hardware.
.LP
The POWERMAN environment variable, if set, if set, identifies an alternate 
directory fo the PowerMan libraries and configuration files.

.SH TARGET NODE LIST OPTIONS
.I "-w host,host,..."
Target the specified nodes.  No spaces are allowed in the comma-separated
list.  Substituting the "-" character for the list causes the target nodes
to be read from stdin, one per line.
.LP
.I "-a"
Target "all" nodes in the cluster.  
.B pm
determines the list of nodes in the cluster from in configuration file
(see FILES below).

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.LP
.I "-c configfile"
Provide an alternate name or location for the configuration file.
.LP
.I "-f number"
Set the maximum concurrency for underlying utilities.  The default is 256.
.I "-l powermandir"
Provide an alternate location for the PowerMan libraries.
.LP
.I "-q"
be quiet, i.e. don't print error messages.
.LP
.I "-r"
reverse, i.e. print nodes that are off rather than on
.LP
.I "-t"
query the CPU temperature(s), if available, rather than the power status.
Output the node name followed by the temperature for the target nodes, one
node per line.

.SH "FILES"

$powermandir/etc/<utility>.conf

$powermandir/lib/<utility-support>

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
The environment variable
.B POWERMANDIR
gives an alternative location for the powerman libraries and low level 
utilities, overriding the default "/usr/lib/powerman".  The "-l" option, 
in turn, overrides the environment variable.  Similarly,
.B POWERMANCONF
gives an alternative file for cluster configuration details.  It 
overrides the default "/etc/powerman.conf" and is, in turn, overridden 
by the "-c" option.   If the 
.B W_COL
(working collective) environment variable is set to a file name then 
the list of nodes is taken from that file, one per line.  "-a", "-b", 
and "-w" all override the working collective envirnment variable.  

.SH "ORIGIN"
Developed by Andrew  Uselton <useton2@llnl.gov> on LLNL's Alpha and
Intel Linux clusters.

.SH "LIMITATIONS"
The computers under control are expected to be part of a cluster, with
each node named with a unique integer at the end of the cluster name, as
in fc0, fc1, fc2,...  A non-numeric naming scheme will break the 
sort function.
