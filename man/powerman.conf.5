.SH NAME
powerman.conf \- configuration file format for pm

.SH DESCRIPTION
This file is read by
.B pm
and contains the name of the cluster under power management and a list
of nodes in the cluster.  For a cluster named "tux" the name appears in 
the configuration file as:
.LP
.RS
cluster tux
.RE
.LP
Nodes appear, one per line, with a name, a power monitoring function, 
and a power control function.  A typical node in the cluster using digi
power monitoring and etherwake power control might look like this:

consist of the cluster name with a unique integer appended.
