.TH POWERMAN.CONF 1 "Release 0.1.9" "LLNL" "POWERMAN.CONF"

.SH NAME
powerman.conf \- configuration file format for pm

.SH DESCRIPTION
This file is read by
.B pm
and contains the name of the cluster under power management and a list
of nodes in the cluster.  For a cluster named "tux" the name appears in 
the configuration file as:
.LP
.RS
cluster tux
.RE
.LP
Nodes appear, one per line, with a name, a power monitoring function, 
and a power control function.  A typical node in the cluster using digi
power monitoring and etherwake power control might look like this:
.LP
.RS
node tux17 {digi /dev/ttyD0} {etherwake 00:11:22:33:44:55}
.RE
.LP
The hardware detail block contained in the curly braces is hardware
dependent.  In the case that power monitoring and power management are
carried out by the same hardware (as in the 
.I icebox
hardware) one may include a single hardware detail block.  If both are
present then the monitoring block comes before the control block.
Each block begins with the name of the hardware (which must correspond
to the 
.I Python 
module's name in /usr/lib/powerman) and includes a list of details
needed by that module.  The source RPM for powerman contains examples
of configurations for each of the supported types.
