.TH PowerMan 1 "Release 1.0" "LLNL" "PowerMan"
.SH NAME
powerman \- power on/off nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B powerman
.I "[-option] [targets]"
.br
.B pm
.I "[-option] [targets]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B powerman
provides power management in a data center or compute cluster environment.  
It performs operations such as power on, power off, and power cycle
via remote power controller (RPC) devices.
Target hostnames are mapped to plugs on RPC devices in 
.I powerman.conf(5).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-1, --on"
Power ON targets.
.TP
.I "-0, --off"
Power OFF targets.
.TP
.I "-c, --cycle"
Power cycle targets.
.TP
.I "-r, --reset"
Assert hardware reset for targets (if implemented by RPC).
.TP
.I "-f, --flash"
Turn beacon ON for targets (if implemented by RPC).
.TP
.I "-u, --unflash"
Turn beacon OFF for targets (if implemented by RPC).
.TP
.I "-l, --list"
List available targets.  If possible, output will be compressed into
a host range (see TARGET SPECIFICATION below).
.TP
.I "-q, --query"
Query plug status of targets.  If none specified, query all targets.
Status is not cached;  each time this option is used, powermand 
queries the appropriate RPC's.  Targets connected to RPC's that could
not be contacted (e.g. due to network failure) are reported as 
status "unknown".  If possible, output will be compressed into host
ranges.
.TP
.I "-n, --node"
Query node power status of targets (if implemented by RPC).  If no targets
specified, query all targets.
In this context, a node in the OFF state could be ON at the plug but 
operating in standby power mode.
.TP
.I "-b, --beacon"
Query beacon status (if implemented by RPC).  If no targets are
specified, query all targets.
.TP
.I "-t, --temp"
Query node temperature (if implemented by RPC).  If no targets are
specified, query all targets.
Temperature information is not interpreted by powerman and is reported
as received from the RPC on one line per target, prefixed by target name.
.TP
.I "-h, --help"
Display option summary.
.TP
.I "-L, --license"
Show powerman license information.
.TP
.I "-d, --server-host host[:port]"
Connect to a powerman daemon on non-default host and optionally port.
.TP
.I "-V, --version"
Display the powerman version number and exit.
.TP
.I "-D, --device"
Displays RPC status information.  If targets are specified, only RPC's
matching the target list are displayed.
.TP
.I "-T, --telemetry"
Causes RPC telemetry information to be displayed as commands are processed.
Useful for debugging device scripts.
.TP
.I "-x, --exprange"
Expand host ranges in query responses.
.SH "TARGET SPECIFICATION"
.B powerman
target hostnames may be specified as comma separated or space separated
hostnames or host ranges.  
Host ranges are of 
the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n < m and l < k, etc.,
This form should not be confused with regular expression character classes 
(also denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1 or 
foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.
.LP
This range syntax is meant
only as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and
specification of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range foo[1,9].
.LP
Some examples of powerman targets follows:
.LP
Power on hosts bar,baz,foo01,foo02,...,foo05
    powerman --on bar baz foo[01-05]
.LP
Power on hosts bar,foo7,foo9,foo10
    powerman --on bar,foo[7,9-10]
.LP
Power on foo0,foo4,foo5
    powerman --on foo[0,4-5]
.LP
As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([
and ]) for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in
tcsh, the last example above should be executed as:
.nf
    powerman --on "foo[0,4-5]"
.fi
