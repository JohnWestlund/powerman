In order to retag something to a new version do the following
1)  increment the version numbers in Makefile, powerman.spec, and pm 
2)  Fix bugs and make changes
3)  cvs commit
4)  you will probaly want to remove the previous version, especially
      if you are installing an identically numbered (but different)
      version during debugging.
	rpm -q powerman
	rpm -e powerman-x.y.z-r
5)  make rpm tag=HEAD
6)  distribute to test sites
7)  rpm -i powerman-x.y.z-r.i386.rpm  (if, like me, you ended up 
            with a bunch of rpm database entires you can't get rid
	    of you may need the --force below, best if you can get
	    on without it by religiously doing step 4)
	rpm -i powerman-x.y.z-r.i386.rpm --force
8)  Verify it's all working as you like.  If it is not then return to
      step 2.
9) When a tag=HEAD version seems to work unmodified, you can just
     update the release number and distribute the tag=HEAD version,
     but this is not reproducable.  Once you've reached a stable point
     you should.  
       a) cvs rtag powerman-x-y-z powerman
          (If you're being naughty and fixing problems in an already
          tagged release then add the -F option, but only do this when
          you can guarantee that you can destroy all the previously
          distributed instances of this version, as during late
          testing) 
       b) make rpm
       c) distribute widely

It is permissable to hand out tag=HEAD versions, which are
irreproducible under this scheme, so long as you make it clear that it
is an interrum solution in an emergency and should be updated as soon
as possible.  When doing so you should use a release version greater
than one.  

local targets for distribution include:
