In order to retag something to a new version do the following
0)  you will probaly want to remove the previous version
	rpm -q powerman
	rpm -e powerman-0.1.7-3
1)  make rpm tag=HEAD
2)  verify it's all working as you like (if, like me, you ended up
            with a bunch of rpm database entires you can't get rid
	    of you may need the --force below, best if you can get
	    on without it)
	rpm -i powerman-0.1.7-4.i386.rpm --force
3)  update the version and release numbers in:
	Makefile
	powerman.spec
	pm
4)  cvs commit
    return to 1 if anything misfired
5)  cvs rtag powerman-<version-with-dashes> powerman
6)  make rpm
7)  verify that it's all working correctly
