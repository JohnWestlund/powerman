PowerMan device specifications are rather wierd.  For this reason, we suggest 
that you leave the writing of these scripts to the PowerMan authors.  However, 
if you insist, here is how they work.  [Note: the authors do not guarantee that
the PowerMan specification language will not change, however we are open to
taking on maintenance of scripts submitted by PowerMan users.  We can't 
guarantee that we'll be able to get hold of a particular model RPC to add
to our PowerMan test fixture but we'll try if it is a common one].

By convention, device scripts are one device per file and are included 
as needed from a powerman.conf file, like this:

  include "/etc/powerman/icebox3.dev"

A device script is surrounded by an outer block:

  specification "my_device_name" {
	# the specification block should contain device-specific 
	# configuration settings and scripts for individual operations
  }

The possible configuration settings are:

  # (optional) device script timeout in seconds - applies to each script,
  # the whole thing, not just a particular "expect" for example
  timeout <float>   

  # (optional) if plug names are static, they should be defined.  Any 
  # reference to a plug name in the powerman.conf must match one of the 
  # defined plug names.  
  plug name { <string list> }

  # (optional) if a ping script is defined, and pingperiod is nonzero, the
  # ping script will be executed periodically, every <float> seconds.
  pingperiod <float>

Script blocks should all be grouped together with no config lines in between.
Scripts are for performing particular operations such as power on, get power
status, etc.  Scripts have inputs and outputs depending on <script_name>
(which is one place where things get pretty kludgey).  Each script block has 
the form:

  script <script_name> {
	# statements
  }
