<font face="Helvetica" color=blue>powerman</font> 
is free Linux software that controls (remotely and in parallel) switched 
<a href="supported.html">power distribution units</a>, 
performing such operations as power on, power off, and power cycle.
With its wayward brother
<a href="http://home.gna.org/conman/">conman</a>, 
it is suitable for remote operation of Linux systems in a data center 
or compute cluster environment.  We find the combination of conman and
powerman particularly useful for remote kernel development!
