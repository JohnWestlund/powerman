PowerMan 1.0.19 testing

1. Physical hardware

The powerman test rig includes the following test hardware(*):

apc.dev 		APC MasterSwitch Plus APP v2.0.0, AOS v2.5.4 
baytech.dev		Baytech RPC-3 F5.00
baytech-rpc28-nc.dev	Baytech RPC28-30NC
icebox.dev		Linux Networx ICE box v2.x
icebox3.dev		Linux Networx ICE box v3.x
wti.dev			WTI NPS 3.02
wti-rps10.dev		WTI RPS-10 (chain of 3)
cyclades-pm8.dev	Cyclades PM8i

All of these are run by one instance of powermand.  Testing of physical
hardware consists of running the following two scripts simultaneously
without errors:

  #!/bin/bash
  (COUNT=1000
  while test $COUNT -gt 0; do
      pm -1 test[0-96]
      pm -q
      pm -0 test[0-96]
      pm -q
      COUNT=`expr $COUNT - 1`
  done) >test.log

  #!/bin/bash
  (COUNT=1000
  while test $COUNT -gt 0; do
      pm -q
      COUNT=`expr $COUNT - 1`
  done) >testq.log

2. Virtual hardware
