On running 'make check':

The test methodlogy here is to run the powerman daemon as a child
of the powerman client, connected via pty.   The powerman daemon in 
turn spawns copies of 'vpcd' (virtual power control device), connected 
via ptys.  Each test starts a fresh powerman+powermand+vpcd(s) so no
state is preserved between tests.

The client can send multiple commands, so we can send commands and
change state and then query the state to see what happened.

The output of each command is compared against expected output.
