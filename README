PowerMan version 1.0.17                                        26 April 2003

+--------------+
| New Features |
+--------------+

o There is now a TELNET device type which filters telnet escapes out of
  the device control stream and manages some trivial option negotiation.
  Telnet escape sequences have been removed from device configurations.

o For devices which dynamically assign "plug names" it is now possible to 
  omit the plug name from the node lines in powerman.conf, and leave off 
  the definition of all possible plug names in the device config.  A new 
  script construct "setplugname" can be used to associate plug names with 
  node names during script execution.

o To make it possible to support devices that have variable numbers of plugs
  PowerMan scripts can now utilize a "foreachplug" or "foreachnode" construct 
  to iterate over the configured plugs or plugs that have configured nodes for
  a device, executing an inner block of script on each iteration.  These
  constructs also reduce repetition in scripts with a fixed number of plugs.

o Support added for IBM RSA Remote Supervisor Adapter in telnet debug mode.
  The ibmrsa.dev script utilizes the three features listed above.

o In addition to the new constructs described above, the device script syntax
  has changed in the following non-backwards compatible way:
  - Instead of repeating 'plug name "name"' statements, all the plug names
    can now be specified on one line, e.g. 'plug name { "name" "name" ... }.
  - The plugcount line is no longer necessary (or allowed).
  - The name line is no longer necessary; device names are specified between
    "specification" and the open brace for the device specification.
  - Device types are no longer quoted strings.
  - The "map" command was renamed to "setstatus" and there can now be
    intervening statements between an "expect" and "setstatus" lines.  
    Subexpression match lines persist until the next "expect" in the script.
  - The "setstatus" command can now take a subexpression offset for the plug
    name parameter in lieu of the literal plug name (quoted string).

| Bugs fixed |
+------------+

o Increased power cycle time to 2 seconds on all power controllers.  The
  ICE box previous value of 0.7 sec caused problems on some nodes.

o Serial connections were made non-blocking (blocking in an open would
  hang powermand).

+-----------------+
| Supported RPC's |
+-----------------+

PowerMan development and testing takes place on the following RPC devices:

o Linux NetworX ICE Box version 2 (V2.2-LLNL B208) (*)

o Linux NetworX ICE Box version 3 (V3.0 B70) (*)

o Baytech RPC-3 (Revision F 5.00 and F 5.01) (*)

o WTI NPS (v3.02)

o APC MasterSwitch Plus (APP v2.0.0 / AOS v2.5.4)

o WTI RPS-10

o IBM RSA Remote Supervisor Adapter (T2ET16- for x335, GEET117A for x345) (*)

o Rackable Systems Phantom Remote Management Module (v3.0.4)

Devices marked with an asterisk (*) are deployed on LLNL production clusters 
of substantial size.

The contents of the doc directory are useful in understanding the basic 
design of PowerMan but the code and data structures have changed 
substantially since that information was created.
