PowerMan version 1.0.16                                     26 December 2002

+--------------+
| New Features |
+--------------+

o --device client option dumps server statistics for each RPC.
  This option can also be used by firmware update scripts to create a list
  of RPC's  The output is one line as follows per RPC:

     rpc_name: reconnects=N actions=M type=device_type hosts=host_range

o --telemetry client option facilitates debugging of device scripts by 
  displaying the powermand<->RPC communication for the action being performed
  by the client.  This option may also be useful in diagnosing a malfunctioning
  RPC (since PowerMan cannot distinguish between "no response" and 
  "unexpected response" - it simply times out and reconnects in either case -
  it is useful to know what an RPC is saying to powermand when timeouts are
  occurring).

o --exprange client option displays query results in one-node-per-line
  format, rather than the compressed summary format that is the default.
  This option affects the --list, --query, --node, and --beacon client options.

o --version option in both client and server displays the powerman version
  and exits.  Also, the client now displays a warning if the client and server
  versions do not match exactly.

o Support added for APC MasterSwitch.

o Baytech RPC-3 cycle left target plugs in the "off" state if the initial state
  was off.

o ICE box V3 beacon command would produce undefined results when acting on 
  multiple beacons in a single ICE box.

The contents of the doc directory are useful in understanding the basic 
design of PowerMan but the code and data structures have changed 
substantially since that information was created.
