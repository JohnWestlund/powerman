PowerMan version 1.0.17                                        26 April 2003

+--------------+
| New Features |
+--------------+

o There is now a "telnet" device type which filters telnet escapes out of
  the device control stream and manages some trivial option negotiation.
  Telnet escape sequences have been removed from device configurations.

o Plug names may be omitted from device configuration, in which case
  node configuration lines provide the plug names for each instantiation
  of the device.

o Support added for IBM RSA Remote Supervisor Adapter in telnet debug mode.

| Bugs fixed |
+------------+

o Increased power cycle time to 2 seconds on all power controllers.  The
  ICE box previous value of 0.7 sec caused problems on some nodes.

The contents of the doc directory are useful in understanding the basic 
design of PowerMan but the code and data structures have changed 
substantially since that information was created.
