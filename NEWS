Release Notes for PowerMan version 2.2                        XX Aug 2008
=========================================================================

* Send a SIGINT to coprocesses rather than just closing file
  descriptors during powermand shutdown.  This is required to 
  terminate an ssh client running in coprocess mode.

* Make it possible to only define the _ranged version of scripts.  Scripts 
  are selected using the following precedence: _all, _ranged, singlet.

* Drop "soft power status" support.  This allowed iceboxes to detect 
  whether a node was powered up or not, independently of plug state.

* [ipmipower] Drop _all and singlet version of scripts. 

* [ilom] Revised Sun Integrated Lights Out Management support 
  to work over ssh and serial.  Dropped shared console/serial 
  "ilom-inline" support.

* [icebox3] Now supports both v3 and v4 Ice Box.  Users of icebox4
  should change their device types to icebox3 in powerman.conf.

* [plmpower] Added support for controlling Insteon/X10 devices via 
  SmartLabs PLM 2412S.

* [hp3488] Added support for modular GPIB-based HP 3488A switch/control 
  unit via gpib-utils project.

* [ics8064] Added support for VXI-11-based ICS 8064 16-port relay unit
  via gpib-utils project.

* [powerman] Improved efficiency of powerman-controlling-powerman 
  configurations, when one powerman controls a subset of the plugs of 
  another powerman through the use of _ranged scripts.

* Enhanced integrated test suite.
  Note: tests all pass on AIX now.
