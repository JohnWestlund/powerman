PowerMan version 1.0.19 News                                     08 Dec 2003


Config file changes:

o Reminder: make these changes before 1.1 is released:
  1. device entries now specify host and port together, e.g.
    device "<name>" "<type>" "<host>:<port>"

  2. the following are deprecated and should be removed.
    begin nodes 
    end nodes
    begin global
    end global
    client listener port <port>

  3. tcpwrappers now takes an argument yes|no.

o If the plug name is omitted from a node line, the node name is used as
  the plug name.

o Node lines can use hostlists.  The plug name cannot be listed; if the device
  has hardwired plug names, assign those in order, otherwise assign node name.
  Example:
    node "t[48-63]" "test3"

o It is now possible to have powerman run programs as "coprocesses" and 
  talk to them via pty's, e.g.:
    device "test3" "vpc" "/home/garlick/projects/powerman/test/vpcd -f |&"


Bugs fixed:

o Login timeouts on baytech RPC-28 (powerman/290)

o Increased ICE box power cycle time from 0.7 sec to 2 sec to resolve
  problems with LinuxBIOS not resetting properly.

o Serial connections were made non-blocking (blocking in an open would
  hang powermand).

o Serial devices are now locked to prevent interference from other utilities
  such as ConMan.

o Workaround for getaddrinfo bug in glibc-2.3.2-27.9 that caused client
  core dumps under RedHat 9.

o Exponential backoff-retry is enforced for script failures (was just
  connection attempts).

o Use poll instead of select to remove scaling obstacles.  Able to test up to
  about 1024 power control devices with 16 plugs each using ptys.


Supported RPC's:

o Linux NetworX ICE Box version 2 and 3

o Baytech RPC-3, RPC-3-20NC, RPC-28-30NC

o WTI NPS, RPS-10

o APC MasterSwitch Plus

o Rackable Systems Phantom Remote Management Module

o Cyclades PM8, PM8i

o IBM x-series H8 service processor (via external 'h8power' utility)

o IPMI on Intel SE7501WV2 Xeon nodes in terminal mode (serial)

o IPMI on Intel Tiger4 Itanium nodes (via external 'ipmipower' utility)
