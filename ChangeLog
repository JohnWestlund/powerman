	* With the release of version 1.0.0 the code has been
	  entirely rewritten.  ChangeLog truncated.
	* Tagged powerman-1-0-0.

2002-07-26 garlick
	* Reformatted ChangeLog
	* Added 'make depend' target to address missing dependencies.
	  Added .c.o production and removed some redundant targets.
	  Modified powerman, powermand targets to match products to address
	  extraneous relinks (src/Makefile).
	* Moved check for root to after process_command_line() so root 
	  privilege is not required to get --help (src/client.c)
	* Moved Report_Memory() to wrappers.c and made allocated_memory static
	  (src/exit_error.c)
	* Added init_error()  and exit_msg() functions to exit_error.
	  The exit_error() function now uses strerror() and does not close
	  file descriptors, flush stderr, or close log before exit.  Added 
	  syslog_on_error() accessor function for syslog_on (src/exit_error.c)
	* Client now uses exit_error.c (src/client.c)
	* Rename some client options per code review.  Reduced verbosity
	  of usage() output. (src/client.c)
	* Config->com is now an enum and command format strings are 
	  individually #defined and end in _FMT (src/client.c)
	* Made all functions in client static and discovered duplicate 
	  functions defined in config.[ch].  Prepended 'x' to client versions
	  for now (factor later) (src/client.h)
	* Added accessor functions and made 'log' private to log module 
	  (src/log.[ch])
	* Made clean target clean up after default target, remove no-op cd
   	  commands, employ make -C where appropriate, do not build vicebox 
	  by default (Makefile)
	* Fixed compilation errors if NDUMP is not defined; added exit callback
	  to init_error() (null in client, set in server if NDUMP defined).
	* Updated powerman.1 to match option changes.
	* bzero->memset
	* Took local includes out of powerman.h (still need to do sys includes)

2002-07-27 garlick
	* Renamed main.[ch] to powermand.[ch]; renamed client.c to powerman.c.
	* Moved set_tv() from powermand.c to config.c.
	* Moved overdue() from powermand.c to device.c.
	* Moved read_Config_file() from config.c to powermand.c and exported
	  init_Client_protocol() from config.c.
	* Created get_String_from_Buffer() buffer in util.[ch] to eliminate
	  dependence of buffer.h pm_string.h.
	* Fixed Delay to account for select EINTR.
	* Created gettimeofday wrapper.
	* Fixed Read/Write to retry on EINTR and handle other errors gracefully
	* Have Free() wrapper clear memory to zero magic cookies, etc..
	* Made Buffer an opaque type with magic cookie.
	* Made String an opaque type with magic cookie.
	* Give appropriate errors when powermand config file is not set or 
	  set improperly, and start with a default config file.
	* Powermand options changed per code review.
	* Moved system includes out of powerman.h.
	* Merged general code review suggestions in to TODO file
	  (but not the specific yet)
	* Added support for quadrics style host ranges in powerman client.
	* Move powermand from bin to sbin.
	* Use standard assert instead of powerman.h one so we get killed
	  with a SIGABORT and get debugger stack traces.
	* Added some list_iterator_destroy's to match list_iterator_create's
	  in powerman.c
	* Pid file stuff moved to pidlock.c and disabled for the moment.

2002-07-28 garlick
	* Fixed bug where log fd was always being checked for writeability
	  in main select loop, chewing 100% of a CPU.
	* Commenting out the "log file" config line now disables logging.
	* Made wrapper Malloc/Free more robust (embed size/magic cookie in
	  each buffer allocated).  Size is no longer a parameter to Free.

2002-07-29 garlick
	* Make --queryon, --queryoff work with or without targets on cmd line.

2002-07-29 dun
	* Fixed parms to gethostbyaddr().

2002-08-01 garlick
	* Do not use ${srcbin} for products.  Clean up other Makefile targets.
	* Added --telemetry to client to allow us to watch protocol happen.
	* Change client to not request list of nodes from daemon unless
	  requesting status.
	* Convert completely over to hostlist.c routines in client.
	* Remove --soft option and always warn if plug=on and node=off.
	* Removed duplicate hostlist handling from pm_string.c.
	* Added powerman init script

2002-08-02 garlick
	* A bit more cleanup in pm_string.c.
	* ON, OFF changed to ST_ON, ST_OFF
	* Transferred all remaining inline review comments.
	* Reworked log.c.
	* Fixed all [v]snprintf's to check for both result == -1 
  	  (glibc <= 2.0.6) and result > len (glibc >= 2.1, C99 standard).

2002-08-05 garlick
	* Moved string stuff out of buffer.c into util.c and refactored.
	* Found problem with short reads, process_script() would delete
	  actions if they didn't match the partial buffer.
	* Config file cleanup (removed second expect "completion" regex,
	  cluster name).
	* Took vicebox.dev out of spec file install.
	* Made a general helper function for wrapped regcomp special
	  character expansion.

2002-08-06 garlick
	* Added --telemetry option to server.

2002-08-07 garlick
	* Did away with Log - just use syslog.  Removed log from configuration 
	  syntax.
	* Added delay back into default powerman.conf.
	* Added "\nnn" (octal byte) support to config file for expect/send 
	  sequences.

2002-08-08 garlick
	* Make some char *'s into unsigned char *'s that are carrying
	  non-printable values such as \376 (baytech telnet telnet handshake)).
	* Redo telemetry logging to support callback at the Buffer level.
	* Telemetry logging on server now shows when expect or delay
	  commands are being processed.
	* Updated baytech and icebox configs to use 10 sec timeout.
	  Baytech at least seems to require > 2sec to respond sometimes.
	  Fixed a thinko I introduced to the config file earlier.
	* Instead of stripping NULL's out of buffers when creating strings,
	  convert them to \377.
	* Fix get_String_from_Buffer() to only consume buffer up to and
	  including regex match - not whole buffer (Gregg H.)
	* Server telemetry now shows the buffer contents when reporting
	  no match.

2002-08-09 garlick
	* Sort hostlists before display in powerman.c
