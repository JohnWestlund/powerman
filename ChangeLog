#    Release 3:
#                PowerMan now issues commands without regard to the 
#       current state of the target nodes, with the exception of the 
#	etherwake device.  For the etherwake device the node must
#	be off before it is turned on, or must be on before it is 
#	turned off or reset.  Reset of an off etherwake node still
#	does not turn it on.
#	         The icebox device now prints its replies in sorted
#	order.  The sort is by tty, then box, then port and the order
#	within those categories is established by the first appearance 
#	in the config file.  
#	         The icebox driver now has two pacing constants, one for
#	per-box commands (4.0 seconds), and one for per-port commands
#	(1.0 seconds).  Commands are issued no more quickly than this 
#	pace.
#	         The error handling is more uniform, with an "exit_error"
#	function and standard error messages declared all in one place.
#	         The icebox driver logs the most recent command and
#	response to the file #powermandir/log/log_file.
#	         The reply from the icebox can be empty and the driver will
#	read again, up to 10 times before failing.
